# FooCoding CLI Homework

The objective of this homework assignment is to practice consuming a RESTful API from the command line interface (CLI) using Node.js. You will be creating a CLI tool that interacts with the Todos API you built earlier, allowing users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on Todos directly from the command line.

## Requirements:

* Create a command line interface (CLI) application using Node.js that interacts with the Todos REST API.
* Implement the following commands in your CLI application:
    * list: Lists all Todos from the API.
    * add <todo>: Adds a new Todo to the API.
    * update <id> <todo>: Updates the Todo with the specified <id> with the new <todo> text.
    * delete <id>: Deletes the Todo with the specified <id>.
    * end or Ctrl+C: Exits the CLI application.
* Ensure proper error handling for cases such as invalid input, failed API requests, etc.
* Make sure the CLI application runs continuously until the user explicitly exits by typing the end command or by pressing Ctrl+C.
* Provide clear instructions within the CLI on how to use each command.
* Handle asynchronous operations gracefully using async/await or Promises.
* Implement basic input validation to prevent malformed input from being sent to the API.

## Optional Enhancements:

* Implement interactive prompts for better user experience using libraries like inquirer or asking me to share code for this, because is something that we can implement by ourselves.
* Add color-coded output or formatting to enhance readability of the CLI output.
* Implement authentication for accessing the API if authentication is required.
* Implement batch processing for handling multiple Todos at once.
* Add support for additional features of the Todos API, such as pagination, sorting, and filtering.
